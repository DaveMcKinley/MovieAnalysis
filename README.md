## Buiness Problem
Microsoft is looking to break into the movie industry and develop their own studio. However, they do not know anything about making movies. We have been tasked with challenge of developing three data backed actionable insights to present to thhe head of the newly formed movie studio.
## Key Performance Indicator
For the Key Performance Indicator we have decided to work with profit margin, more specifically, average profit margin. Why use profit margin? As Investopedia states, "Profit margins are used by creditors, investors, and businesses themselves as indicators of a company's financial health, management's skill, and growth potential." We feel these are good indicators to use as Microsoft enters the movie market.
## Metrics and Data
The four factors our analysis led us to were movie genres, movie ratings (Aka pg 13, rated r, etc.), the prime month to release movies and production cost. The data we used was independently web scraped from the IMDB data set along with the Numbers Production and Revenue Data set (1995 to the present). Then for all analysis we used average profit margin. 
# Conclusion
As we synthesize our data and analysis. We look at the profitably of genres and ratings movies, while taking into consideration the good business practice of keeping costs low and timing the market for maximum profits. Through these results we recommend Microsoft releases a G/PG Animated film in the early part of the year to take advantage of the peaks in January and February, a strong PG -13 rated Drama in mid to late July or August to catch the summer profits and into Labor Day and to compete for the Oscars. And a R rated Horror in early October to take advantage of strong profitability in the autumn months. Following this route will maximize your profit margins throughout the year and lead to establishing Microsoft as a player in the movies industry for decades to come.

### 5.  Findings and Visualizations
Firstly, our analysis on which movie genres to gain the most profit, led us to the conclusion that Horror, Animation, and Drama were the best to put your money into. Although unnecessary, we decided that the inclusion of some popular movies in these genres might help give you more of an understanding when deciding what kind of films you may wish to create. Here it can be easily deduced that Horror animation and drama are at the highest average profit margin percentage.




Rated g/pg and rated r were the most profitable. Reasons why, include how rated g/pg offers more to the general audience and can have more people such as a whole family come to view the movie. This would overall be more profitable for the movie itself. Also for rated r, it’s diversity in movies not allowed to be shown to children under 17 creates excitement in something new and makes itself popular to adults already and teenagers who haven’t been exposed to those kinds of movies. We have our bar chart to show how rated g and pg are the highest with rated r right after. We decided to combine our g/pg as one due to their related children animated movies. 




We analyzed which months would be the best for movie release and came to the decision that May, June, July, and December would be the best. The reasons for this include how May, June, and July, fit the summer category where students will be done with school and have more time to go to the movie theatres with friends to blow off steam after finishing their finals. December also shows to be an important factor since it is when the Oscar academy awards come to close. Movies will tend to show their movies more in order to boost votes which is a big reason why December would be a prime time to release their films. As shown below to corroborate our decision is our Average Profit Margin per month bar chart. 



This chart shows the average profit margin across the Genres and organized by ratings. The G rating holds a consistantly higher profit margin across the genres, with the expecption of Horror and Crime. With those having no G rated films represented in the genres. It is curious to note R's unusally high represntation in the Animation genre. This would warrant further exploration into the data.



As we can see here the Horror genre has a much lower production cost than its counterparts. Drama has a middling production cost to boost its profitability. And while Animation does have a high production cost, as we have seen the animation profits are quite lucrative.


We see Horror and drama among other genres pull down the cost of making R rated movies. Keeping in mind Animated movie production costs we see a rise in the production costs for G and PG movies.


This line graph shows the highest average profit margin each month for the top three genres, Horror, Animation and Drama.The poits of interest here include peaks for Horror in Jan, May, September. This could be due to lower competition during these times. The rise in profit margins for Drama in September and at the end of the year may conincide with "Oscar Season" where studios will release their Oscar competitors. This would also explain the drop at the beginning of year; Oscar competitors may be forgotton by the time Oscar voting comes around. The peaks and valleys of Animation follow the school breaks with peaks In February May and December. The lower profit margins for all genres in the summer may do to higher competition with the box office revenues being more split between all of the genres.



This graph is showing average profit margin for each rating each momth. G ratings have a high profit margin in January and August through October. This matches with the idea that kids are still on breaks from school and less competition from more adult rated movies. The sharp decline at the end of the year may be due to Oscar Season and studios more focused on serious, adult focused movies. PG Ratings mostly follow the same trends with less viariation in the data set. Rises in the data could be responsible to kids getting older and wanting to see movies focused on an older demographic. PG-13 Movies hold their profit margins consitantly through out the year. This could be due to targeting of a perfect mix of different demographics to maintain a reliable profit margin. R rated movies are very consistant as well. There are peaks in the data during the summer months where studio release their action blockblusters and in October where Horror movies, which tend to be R rated. Unsurprisingly, there are dips in profit margins for each rating at different points during the summer, when competition increases.
