## Buiness Problem
Microsoft is looking to break into the movie industry and develop their own studio. However, they do not know anything about making movies. We have been tasked with challenge of developing three data backed actionable insights to present to thhe head of the newly formed movie studio.
## Key Performance Indicator
For the Key Performance Indicator we have decided to work with profit margin, more specifically, average profit margin. Why use profit margin? As Investopedia states, "Profit margins are used by creditors, investors, and businesses themselves as indicators of a company's financial health, management's skill, and growth potential." We feel these are good indicators to use as Microsoft enters the movie market.
## Metric
The four factors our analysis led us to were movie genres, movie ratings (Aka pg 13, rated r, etc.), the prime month to release movies and production cost. The data we used was independently web scraped from the IMDB data set along with the Numbers Production and Revenue Data set (1995 to the present). Then for all analysis we used average profit margin. 
#Conclusion
As we synthesize our data and analysis. We look at the profitably of genres and ratings movies, while taking into consideration the good business practice of keeping costs low and timing the market for maximum profits. Through these results we recommend Microsoft releases a G/PG Animated film in the early part of the year to take advantage of the peaks in January and February, a strong PG -13 rated Drama in mid to late July or August to catch the summer profits and into Labor Day and to compete for the Oscars. And a R rated Horror in early October to take advantage of strong profitability in the autumn months. Following this route will maximize your profit margins throughout the year and lead to establishing Microsoft as a player in the movies industry for decades to come.
